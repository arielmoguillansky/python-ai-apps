# Avengers: The Final Stand (Python Adventure)

A text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game built as a Python logic exercise. The player takes on the role of Iron Man in a 5-step decision-making gauntlet to defeat Thanos.

## Technical Features

- Control Flow: Uses deeply nested if-elif-else statements to create a branching narrative path.

- Input Handling: Implements .lower() method on user strings to ensure case-insensitive comparisons and prevent "hidden" logic errors.

- Linear Success Path: Designed with a 5-tier depth requirement, where only one specific combination of choices leads to the Win state.

- Conditional Logic: Evaluates string equality to determine the progression of the game state.

## How to Play

- Run the script in any Python 3 environment.

- Read the scenario prompts carefully.

- Type your choice (e.g., A or B) and press Enter.

- If you make a tactical error, the game ends immediately. Reach Step 5 to win.
